                <hr>
                <p>Dr Richard Feynman, was born May 11, 1918 in New York, U.S. and died February 15, 1988 in Los Angeles, California. He was an American theoretical physicist who was widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in his field in the post-World War II era and also played a crucial role in the Manhattan Project. Known particularly for his revolutionary work in quantum electrodynamics he was also regarded as one of the best teachers known to the field of physics. His lectures were highly praised and are in fact still used today as a 3 volume set known as the Feynman Lectures which can be found by clicking the link below:</p>
